                          Building relationships with probate attorneys and estate planners can be highly rewarding for
                          a real estate agent. These professionals often encounter clients who need expert assistance in

                          to grieve, while also trying to deal with managing the complexities that come with handling
                          their loved ones' estate. The amount of stress involved is insane. I wanted to help. I know I
                          can't take all the stress away, but one thing I can do is help folks navigate the probate
                          process. By handling that, it gave them more time to focus on what really matters; mourning.
